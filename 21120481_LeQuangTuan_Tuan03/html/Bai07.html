    <h1>MH17 crash: Russia vetoes UN resolution
        for international tribunal</h1>
    <div class="newpaper">
        Russia has used its veto at
        the UN to block a draft
        resolution to set up an
        intemational tribunal into
        the NIHI 7 air disaster in
        July 2014. It was the only
        nation at the 15-member
        UN Security Council to
        oppose the move,
        triggering widespread
        condemnation.
        <p></p>
        The Malaysian Airlines
        flight from Amsterdam to
        Kuala Lumpur crashed in
        eastem Ukraine, killing all
        298 people on board. Pro-
        Russian rebels in the area
        have denied shooting
        cloun the aircraft. Westem
        nations and Ukraine say
        there is evidence it was hit
        by a Russian-supplied Buk
        anti-aircraft missile - a
        claim also denied by
        Russia. 'Callous disregard'
        <p></p>
        Malaysia pushed for an
        intemational tribunal to try
        those responsible. The
        move was backed by the
        Netherlands - which had
        196 nationals on board -
        Ukraine. Belgium and
        Australia. Moscow has
        blamed the government in
        Kiev for the disaster.
        Eleven of the 15
        Security Council members
        backed the dnft resolution
        Speaking earlier this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the establishment of a tlibunal would be
        "premature" and "counter-productive".
